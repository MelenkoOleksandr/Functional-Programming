# Lab1: Haskell Information System

## Description
This project involves creating a Haskell program using classes and instances to implement an information system for a faculty network newspaper. The database tables contain information such as article or graphic material titles, authors, annotation text, publication files, reader information and their reviews, and statistics for individual materials. The system should support the introduction and modification of information. The number of tables should be more than 5.

## Implementation
The implementation of the information system includes defining classes and instances in Haskell to represent the entities involved in the newspaper system. This includes tables for articles, authors, readers, reviews, statistics, and potentially additional user-related information.

## Usage
- Use the provided Haskell files to define the data structures and operations for the information system.
- Adjust the database connection settings in the main file (`Main.hs`) to match your PostgreSQL setup.
- Run the program to interact with the information system.

# Lab2: Parallel Gaussian Elimination for Linear Systems

## Description
This lab involves solving a system of linear equations using a parallel variant of the Gaussian elimination method. The parallel implementation aims to improve the efficiency of solving large systems of equations by leveraging parallel processing capabilities.

## Implementation
The implementation will likely involve parallelizing the steps of the Gaussian elimination algorithm using Haskell's concurrent programming features.

## Usage
- Use the parallel Gaussian elimination implementation to efficiently solve systems of linear equations.
- Ensure that the program scales well with the size of the linear system.

# Problems

## Problem 1: Knight's Tour on a Chessboard

### Description
Find a path for a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits each square exactly once.

### Implementation
Develop an algorithm to determine a valid path for the knight on the chessboard, ensuring that it covers all squares exactly once.

## Problem 4: Paths in a Connected Graph

### Description
Determine all paths in a connected graph from one selected vertex to another.

### Implementation
Create a solution that identifies and lists all possible paths between a starting vertex and a destination vertex in a connected graph.

## Usage
- Implement the solution for the knight's tour problem and the connected graph path problem.
- Apply the solutions to specific scenarios or graph instances.
- Analyze the efficiency and correctness of the implemented algorithms.
